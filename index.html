            My name is Cameron and I am 20 years old. I am currently working full time as a leasing agent and a student in the 
            University of Utah coding bootcamp. My goal after this bootcamp is get a good career in computer science. I will 
            start by getting a job in web development and will continue to go to school so I can learn as much as I can about 
            computer science and advance up to a computer engineer or software engineer.
        </p>

            I enjoy many things such as playing video games, riding my motorcycle, and being outside in the sun.
